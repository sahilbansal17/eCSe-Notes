The following books are recommended for Algebra course - 
1. Topics in Algebra by **I.N. Herstein**
2. Contemporary Abstract Algebra by **Joseph A. Gallian**

The course mainly deals with - 
1. Group Theory
2. Ring Theory
3. Field Theory

### Preliminaries
Much of abstract algebra involves properties of integers and sets. 

** What is a set ?**
A set is a collection of well-defined **distinct** objects.
for e.g. :

$$ \mathbb{Z} = {0, \pm 1, \pm 2, ... } $$

An important property of the integers is the **well-ordering principle.**

#### Well-Ordering Principle
Every non-empty set of positive integers contains a smallest member.

#### Division Algorithm
Let **a** and **b** be integers with **b > 0**. Then there exist unique integers **q** and **r** with the property that:
$$ a = bq + r, 0\leq r < b $$

##### Definitions - Greatest Common Divisor

#### GCD is a Linear Combination

##### Euclid's Lemma p|ab implies p|a or p|b

#### Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic

##### Definitions - Least Common Multiple

### Mathematical Induction
#### 1. First Principle of Mathematical Induction

#### 2. Second Principle of Mathematical Induction
